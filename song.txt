This is the type of music believed to be responsible
For a wave of attacks on churches in Northern Europe
It's avertedly anti-christian and synonymous with Satanic worship
This church in Bergen, Norway was burned to the ground

I never get no sleep how my money all spent
But one day, I'ma die, and it won't mean shit
I'm sick of seein' kids tryin' to rap like this
Take that band tee off, you don't listen to that shit

Bitch, I'm an introverted, inverted cross rappin'
Motherfucker, go bump please leave me alone, black metal pumpin'
Out my whip, I'm gettin' in touch with Lucifer again
I was doin' fine, but now I think I'm givin' into temptation, Mane

I don't work a job no more
I don't hate life no more
JK really just wanna croak
Granny find me dead on the floor
But I won't overdose
I don't pop pills like you
Speakin' to Hermes alone
You'll know what I mean, you lost

Friday, I'ma trip all day
Saturday, I'ma drink codeine
Sunday, I'ma post up at the church
Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed
